// For the arithmetic operations on possibly boolean values, we need to ensure they're numbers:
const billableHours = Number(timeEntry.billable) * timeEntry.hours;

// For the arithmetic operations on string | boolean, convert to numbers first:
const totalBillableHours = typeof project.billed === 'boolean' ? 
  (project.billed ? Number(project.tracked) : 0) : 
  Number(parseCurrency(String(project.billed)));

// Fix function calls with wrong number of arguments, assuming they're toast calls:
toast.success("Time entry added");
toast.success("Time entry updated");
toast.success("Time entry deleted");
